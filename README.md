## Key Takeaways
Having separate files for HTML and CSS is better than doing inline CSS especially when you are doing a project that is more large-scale. CSS also does wonder to your website, you really just have to be creative and there are a lot of resources on the net if you're looking to do a specific design or feature for your site.
